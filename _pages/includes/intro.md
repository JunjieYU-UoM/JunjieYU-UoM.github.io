[<span style="font-size:18px;">**Welcome to my PhD projects: Urban climate adaptation**</span>](https://junjieyu-uom.github.io/UrbanClimateAdaptation)

I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.ees.manchester.ac.uk/), [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) (UoM), United Kingdom, under the supervision of Dr. [Zhonghua Zheng](https://zhonghuazheng.com/) (Assistant Professor in Data Science & Environmental Analytics) and Prof. [David Topping](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/david.topping) (Professor of the Digital Environment, UoM; Fellow of the Alan Turing Data Science Institute). 

I earned my Master's degree in Environmental Engineering (2023) from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) (UCAS, China), hosted by [Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences](http://www.rcees.cas.cn/) (RCEES), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/) (CAS) (one of the top research units for ecology and environmental sciences), under the supervision of Prof. [Dongsheng Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0021195) (2022- Zhejiang University, China) and the collaboration of Dr. [Hui Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hui-Xu-61/research). Before that, I received my B.Eng. in Environmental Engineering (2020) from [China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing](https://www.cumtb.edu.cn/) (CUMTB, China), under the supervision of Prof. [Caihong Yu](https://scee.cumtb.edu.cn/info/1024/1144.htm).

My research focuses on applying statistics, reinforcement learning/optimization, and data-driven modeling to solve environmental problems, including intelligent urban adaptation, urban climate modeling, climate downscaling, and public health.
